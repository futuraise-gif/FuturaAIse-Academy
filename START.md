# 🎉 Almost There! Final Steps

## ✅ What's Configured

- ✅ Frontend environment (.env) with Firebase config
- ✅ Backend environment (.env)
- ✅ Firebase Admin SDK installed
- ✅ Frontend is running at http://localhost:3000

## ⚠️ One More Thing - Enable Firebase Authentication

Before we can use the app, you need to enable Authentication in Firebase Console:

### 📋 Steps (2 minutes):

1. **Open Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/futureaise-a45b5/authentication

2. **Click "Get started"** (if you see it)

3. **Go to "Sign-in method" tab**

4. **Enable Email/Password**:
   - Click on "Email/Password"
   - Toggle "Enable" to ON
   - Click "Save"

5. **Check Firestore** (should already be enabled):
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/futureaise-a45b5/firestore
   - If it's not enabled, click "Create database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode"
   - Click "Enable"

## 🚀 Once Done

The backend has some TypeScript configuration issues with the old PostgreSQL files. 

**Let me create a simpler version that will work immediately!**

Just let me know when you've enabled Authentication and I'll give you a working backend!
